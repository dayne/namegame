namegame
========

Cheesy little game where defeating an opponent rewards an additional name

To run it:
  ruby nameGame.rb

Command list(to date: 4-14-13)

help - lists available commands

new - creates a new hero

list - lists living heroes

fallen - lists dead heroes

spar - initiates combat w/ no deaths and no name rewards

fight - initiates combat w/ death and name rewards

save - saves heroes and fallen to like .txt files *will overwrite indescriminately at the moment*

load - loads heroes and fallen *will overwrite current games creations*

*here is my disclaimer about the code at the moment... it's pretty messy.*
*as I figured out how things worked I sortof just plowed on and as a result it's not yet... pretty, but that will change soon.*

*post script disclaimer - I've forgotten any and all things about markdown*

enjoy
